# BCH-63-56-
This is the MATLAB and Verilog HDL realization of the encoder and decoder of BCH(63,56) channel coding.
For the decoder part, I use two method for implementation (See reference 1 and 2).
Most of the work was finised during my graduation project of bachelor degree @Beihang University, Beijing, China in 2017.
