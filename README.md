# BCH-63-56
CCSDS BCH (63, 56) Encoder and Decoder Based on MATLAB and FPGA
CCSDS标准中BCH(63,56)码的编译码MATLAB与FPGA实现
----
This is the MATLAB and Verilog HDL realization of the encoder and decoder of BCH(63,56) channel coding.<br>
I first use MATLAB to verify the algorithm, and then use the hardware programming language Verilog HDL to realize it.<br>
For the decoder part, I use two method for implementation (See reference 1 and 2).<br>
Most of the work was finised during my graduation project of bachelor degree @Beihang University, Beijing, China in 2017.<br>
